Online Store - Microservices Architecture
A modern e-commerce platform built using microservices architecture with .NET Core and Docker containerization.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
This project implements a distributed microservices architecture with the following services:

API Gateway - Central entry point for all client requests
Users Service - User management and authentication
Products Service - Product catalog and inventory management
Orders Service - Order processing and management
Payments Service - Payment processing and transactions
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: .NET Core / C#
Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
Architecture: Microservices
API Gateway: Custom implementation

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
.NET Core SDK (version 6.0 or later)
Docker
Docker Compose
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ghayth-Moustpha/onlinestore.git
cd onlinestore 
Based on the GitHub repository structure I can see, this appears to be a microservices-based online store built with C# and Docker. Here's a comprehensive README for your project:

2. **Build and run with Docker Compose**

```shellscript
docker-compose up --build
```


3. **Alternative: Run individual services**

```shellscript
# Navigate to each service directory and run
cd api_gateway
dotnet run

cd ../users_services
dotnet run

# Repeat for other services...
```




## Configuration

Each microservice can be configured through:

- `appsettings.json` files in each service directory
- Environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`
- Service-specific configuration files


## API Endpoints

The API Gateway exposes unified endpoints for:

- **Users**: `/api/users/*`
- **Products**: `/api/products/*`
- **Orders**: `/api/orders/*`
- **Payments**: `/api/payments/*`


> **Note**: Detailed API documentation will be available once the services are running.



## Docker Support

The project includes full Docker support with:

- Individual Dockerfiles for each service
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Development and production configurations


### Running with Docker

```shellscript
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start
docker-compose up --build
```

## Testing

```shellscript
# Run tests for all services
dotnet test

# Run tests for specific service
cd users_services
dotnet test
```

## Monitoring & Health Checks

Each service includes:

- Health check endpoints
- Logging configuration
- Performance monitoring capabilities
